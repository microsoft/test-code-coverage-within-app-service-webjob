# Test Code Coverage running within App Service WebJob

## Problem

Run (Test) Code Coverage from within Azure DevOps Pipeline in order to run the Acceptance Automated Tests on Azure App Service - WebJob.
Alternatively the tests could be run on the hosted (or self-hosted) agent but running them on the App Service - WebJob is closer to the production environment (e.g. WebJob process may have different run behavior, environmental variables, etc) 


## Out of scope

The document doesn't cover DevOps tool Continuous Delivery pipeline (e.g. Azure DevOps Pipelines) for deployment, test run and test code coverage collection from within the DevOps tool. Only approach to run the code coverage collection from within the App Service WebJob is covered.

## Solution Options

### Option 1 - Run the job with parameters

When WebJob is packaged with run.cmd, this command becomes the main entry point. The run.cmd can start a dotnet app by providing parameters or by wrapping the execution with dotnet dotnet-coverage collect command.
The dotnet dotnet-coverage collect produces output and save it within the App Service temporary files "local" (e.g. C:\local\Temp\jobs\triggered\TestCodeCoverageConsoleApp\kfeo0l33.lvo)
If enabled, the files can be accessed via FTP protocol as described here https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Accessing-files-via-ftp
Otherwise, the file can be copied by using command in the run.cmd and saved to one of the folder of the shared file storage system as described here https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Understanding-the-Azure-App-Service-file-system. Such shared file can be accessed by using Azure Storage REST API or Storage File Explorer tool.

Following run.cmd installs the dotnet-coverage tool from nuget.org and runs test console app to collect the coverage

```
dotnet
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install --local dotnet-coverage
dotnet dotnet-coverage collect .\TestCodeCoverageConsoleApp.exe
```

### Other options

Only approach for using dotnet native code coverage tools is described here. There are obviously many code coverage tools available and approach for code coverage collection when using these tools may be different.
